# About

Hi! I am Yilun (杨逸伦), a PhD student under supervision of Prof. Dr. J. Ignacio Cirac and Dr. Mari Carmen Bañuls at the [Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/theory), in Garching near Munich.   

I attended the Master program [*Theoretical and Mathematical Physics*](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/TMP/) in Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Technical University of Munich. Before moving to Germany, I did my bachelor in the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) in Beijing. I was also a visiting student at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford.

My research currently focuses on developing techniques to study thermal and dynamical properties of quantum many body systems, including 

- numerical methods based on tensor network algorithms 
- schemes of quantum simulation, especially on NISQ devices. 

You can see my previous projects on page [research]({{< ref "/research.md" >}}).
