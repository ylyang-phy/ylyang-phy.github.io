Hi! I am Yilun (杨逸伦), a postdoctoral scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/home), hosted by Prof. Lin Lin. 

I obtained my PhD degree under supervision of Prof. J. Ignacio Cirac and Dr. Mari Carmen Bañuls at the [Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/theory), in Garching near Munich. Before that, I attended the Master program [Theoretical and Mathematical Physics](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/TMP/index.html) in LMU and TU Munich, and bachelor courses in the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in Beijing. I was also a visiting student at [St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford](https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/).


My research currently focuses on developing techniques to study thermal and dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems, including 

- numerical methods based on tensor network algorithms 
- quantum algorithms, especially for near-time devices. 

Please refer to research page for my previous works on 
- [spectral analysis with energy filters](research/filter/)
- [methods for quantum simulation](research/qsim/)
