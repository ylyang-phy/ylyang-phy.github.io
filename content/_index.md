Hi! I am Yilun, a PhD student in the group of Prof. J. Ignacio Cirac at the Max-Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, in Garching near Munich. 


My research interest focuses on 
- tensor network algorithms and applications, especially to dynamics and equilibration of many body systems;
- quantum simulation.

You can see my previous projects on page "research".
