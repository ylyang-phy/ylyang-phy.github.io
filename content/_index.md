# About

Hi! I am Yilun (杨逸伦), a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley, hosted by Prof. Lin Lin. 

I obtained my PhD degree under supervision of Prof. J. Ignacio Cirac and Dr. Mari Carmen Bañuls at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, in Garching near Munich. Before that, I attended the Master program *Theoretical and Mathematical Physics* in LMU and TU Munich, and bachelor courses in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. I was also a visiting student at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford.

My research currently focuses on developing techniques to study thermal and dynamical properties of quantum many body systems, including 

- numerical methods based on tensor network algorithms 
- schemes of quantum simulation, especially on NISQ devices. 

You can see my previous projects on page [research]({{< ref "/research.md" >}}).
