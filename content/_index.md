Hi! I am Yilun (杨逸伦), a PhD student in the group of Prof. Dr. J. Ignacio Cirac at the <a href="https://www.mpq.mpg.de/theory"> Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics</a>, in Garching near Munich.  

My research currently focuses on
- tensor network algorithms and applications, especially to in-and-out-of equilibrium properties of many body systems;
- quantum simulation on NISQ devices.

You can see my previous projects on page [research]({{< ref "/research.md" >}}).

I attended the Master program <a href="https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/TMP/">&Prime;Theoretical and Mathematical Physics&Prime;</a> in Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Technical University of Munich. Before moving to Germany, I did my bachelor in the <a href="https://www.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in Beijing.
