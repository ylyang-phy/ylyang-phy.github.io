Hi! I am Yilun (杨逸伦), a PhD student in the group of Prof. Dr. J. Ignacio Cirac at the Max-Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, in Garching near Munich. 

My research interest focuses on 
- tensor network algorithms and applications, especially to in-and-out-of equilibrium properties of many body systems;
- quantum simulation on NISQ devices.

You can see my previous projects on page &Prime;research&Prime;.

I attended the Master program &Prime;Theoretical and Mathematical Physics&Prime; in Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Technical University of Munich. Before moving to Germany, I did my bachelor in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
