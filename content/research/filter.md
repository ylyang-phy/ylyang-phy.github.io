## ***Thermalization probes of many body systems by filtering***

A (Gaussian) filter {{< katex >}} P_{\delta} (E) = \exp[-(E-H)^2 / 2\delta^2] {{< /katex >}} as a energy projector can filter out irrelevant energy eigenstates, which can be efficiently implemented with tensor networks in one-dimensional systems. We provide a technique for ***spectral analysis*** of quantum many body systems using such filters, which can be applied to detect in and out of equilibrium properties of both fixed initial states and the whole spectrum.
