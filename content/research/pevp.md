## ***Error-mitigated digital quantum simulation of thermalization***

- - -

Quantum simulation is one of the most promising scientific applications of quantum computers. Due to decoherence and noise in current devices, it is however challenging to perform digital quantum simulation in a regime that is intractable with classical computers. In this work, we propose a practical experimental protocol for probing dynamics and equilibrium properties on near-term digital quantum computers. The key ingredients are:

1. The trotterization of Hamiltonian can be viewed as a Floquet driving. Thus the ***prethermalization*** phenomenon can be taken into consideration, which resembles the thermalization of the model underlying the Trotterization up to long times independent of the system size.
2. We propose an error mitigation scheme that based on the measurement and rescaling of survival probabilities. For noises that can be written as Krause operators, we prove that this strategy works up to a constant circuit depth, also independent of the system size.
