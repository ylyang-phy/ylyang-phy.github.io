## Thermalization probes of quantum many body systems by filtering

We provide a technique for spectral analysis of quantum many body systems, which can be applied to detect both initial state thermalization and energy eigenstate thermalization. A (Gaussian) filter `\( P_{\delta} (E) = \exp[-(E-H)^2 / 2\delta^2] \)` as a energy projector can filter out irrelevant energy eigenstates of the spectrum. Such filters can be efficiently implemented with tensor networks in one-dimensional systems.
