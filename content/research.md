## Error-mitigated digital quantum simulation of thermalization



- To be available soon



## Thermalization probes of quantum many body systems by filtering

We provide a filtering technique for spectral analysis of quantum many body systems with tensor networks, which can be applied to detect both initial state thermalization and energy eigenstate thermalization.
