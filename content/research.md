## ***Error-mitigated digital quantum simulation of thermalization***

Quantum simulation is one of the most promising scientific applications of quantum computers. Due to decoherence and noise in current devices, it is however challenging to perform digital quantum simulation in a regime that is intractable with classical computers. In this work, we propose a ***practical*** experimental protocol for probing dynamics and equilibrium properties on near-term digital quantum computers. As a key ingredient, we show that it is possible to study thermalization even with a relatively coarse Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution of interest. The so-called ***prethermal*** dynamics closely resemble the thermalization of the model underlying the Trotterization up to long times. Also, We extend the reach of our approach by developing an ***error mitigation scheme*** based on measurement and rescaling of survival probabilities.

## ***Thermalization probes of quantum many body systems by filtering***

A (Gaussian) filter {{< katex >}} P_{\delta} (E) = \exp[-(E-H)^2 / 2\delta^2] {{< /katex >}} as a energy projector can filter out irrelevant energy eigenstates, which can be efficiently implemented with tensor networks in one-dimensional systems. We provide a technique for ***spectral analysis*** of quantum many body systems using such filters, which can be applied to detect in and out of equilibrium properties of both fixed initial states and the whole spectrum.
